# Learn with LeitSpeed! 

The Leitner system was a method of studying developed by German science journalist, Sebastien Leitner in the 1970's. Leitner's approach hinged on using flashcards to study learning material using the principle of spaced repition - another learning principle explored by Leitner's predecessor, Hermann Ebbinghaus. Ebbinghause defined what he called "the forgetting curve" and the "spacing effect." 

Using these principles a student can tackle learning almost anything by spacing their learning, and lessening the forgetting curve. 

With LeitSpeed you can make your own collection of digital flashcards, and study them using the Leitner system of spaced repitition.
